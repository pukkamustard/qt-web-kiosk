# QT Web Kiosk

An experimental [QtWebEngine](https://wiki.qt.io/QtWebEngine) based kiosk. Cool thing about QtWebEngine is that it uses Chromium under the hood. Using it might even be an easy way to compile Chromium for specialized systems.

## Quick start

- `nix build`
- `./result/bin/qt-web-kiosk`
